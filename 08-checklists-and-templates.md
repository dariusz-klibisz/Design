# Decision Guides, Checklists & Templates

Use these templates and checklists to turn the principles in [`01`](01-architecture-principles.md)–[`07`](07-security-reliability-operations.md) into concrete, recorded decisions. Adapt each to your project's risk and team size — a small internal tool and a regulated platform need different levels of rigor.

## 3. Quality Attribute Scenario Template

```md
## Quality Attribute Scenario

Attribute: Reliability | Performance | Security | Accessibility | etc.

Source:           Who or what triggers the scenario?
Stimulus:         What happens?
Environment:      Under what conditions?
Artifact:         What part of the system is affected?
Response:         What should the system do?
Response Measure: How will we measure success?

Example:
Under normal production load, when a user submits checkout, the system
returns a confirmed order or actionable failure within 2 seconds at p95,
without double-charging the user.
```

## 14. Pattern Selection Matrix

| Problem | Candidate Pattern | Avoid If |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codebase hard to change but one deployment is acceptable | Modular monolith | Teams require independent deployment now |
| Teams need independent delivery and service ownership | Microservices | Domain boundaries or operations are immature |
| Legacy replacement is risky | Strangler fig | Coexistence is impossible |
| External model would pollute domain | Anti-corruption layer | External model should be canonical |
| Burst traffic overloads downstream | Queue-based load leveling | User needs immediate completion |
| Remote dependency fails intermittently | Retry with backoff | Operation is not idempotent |
| Remote dependency failure cascades | Circuit breaker | Local deterministic call |
| Read model differs from write model | CQRS | Simple CRUD is enough |
| Need full audit/history | Event sourcing | Schema evolution/privacy deletion conflicts unresolved |
| Multi-service transaction | Saga | Atomic consistency is mandatory |
| Database update plus event publish | Transactional outbox | Event loss acceptable or event store is primary |
| Different clients need different API shapes | Backend for frontend | All clients need identical API |
| Large shared deployment blast radius | Deployment stamps / cells | Small system, low isolation needs |

## 16. Legacy Modernization Decision Log (Lightweight)

```md
## Capability being modernized
## Current behavior & hidden rules discovered
## Slice strategy (route / user group / workflow)
## Coexistence & data-sync approach
## Anti-corruption boundary
## Rollback / route-control plan
## End-state ownership
## Risks & mitigations
```

Pairs with the **Strangler Fig** and **Anti-Corruption Layer** patterns ([02 §4.8](02-architecture-patterns.md#48-strangler-fig-legacy-modernization), [§8.5](02-architecture-patterns.md#85-context-mapping--anti-corruption-layer-acl)).

## 17. Mobile Application Checklist

Mirrors the [Web](#7-web-application-checklist) and [Desktop](#8-desktop-application-checklist) checklists for the mobile surface ([`12`](12-mobile-application-design.md)).

### Lifecycle & State
- [ ] UI state survives rotation/configuration change.
- [ ] UI state survives process death while backgrounded (`ViewModel`+`SavedStateHandle` / scene restoration).
- [ ] Background work uses the OS scheduler (`WorkManager`/`BGTaskScheduler`), not polling or wake-locks.

### Offline & Sync
- [ ] Offline behavior defined (read-only, queued writes, or explicit hard failure).
- [ ] Sync conflict-resolution strategy chosen deliberately (not silent LWW).
- [ ] Sync status visible to the user.

### Security (OWASP MASVS)
- [ ] Meets **MASVS-L1** baseline at minimum; **L2**/**R (Resilience)** assessed for finance/health/high-value apps.
- [ ] Secrets stored in Keychain (iOS) / Keystore + EncryptedSharedPreferences (Android) — never in `UserDefaults`/`SharedPreferences`/the binary.
- [ ] No API keys or backend credentials embedded in the client.
- [ ] Server-side enforcement of every security-relevant decision (not client-side checks alone).
- [ ] Certificate/TLS validation enabled in the production build.

### Performance
- [ ] Cold-start time measured.
- [ ] Profiled on real low/mid-tier devices, not just flagship simulators/emulators.
- [ ] Battery/network impact reviewed (no unnecessary polling, GPS, or wakeups).

### Accessibility
- [ ] VoiceOver (iOS) / TalkBack (Android) smoke-tested on critical flows.
- [ ] Touch targets meet minimum size guidance.
- [ ] Dynamic type / font scaling supported.

### Release
- [ ] Signing key (upload key / provisioning) protected outside the repo.
- [ ] Staged rollout used (Play rollout %, iOS phased release), with crash/ANR monitoring before ramping.
- [ ] Minimum-supported-client-version policy defined for server APIs.
- [ ] Store policy compliance reviewed (permission justification, data-use disclosures).

## 18. Standards Conformance Triage

A fast way to determine **which standards/compliance frameworks actually apply** to a system, before treating any of them as required work. Run through this once at project kickoff or a major architecture review; record the answers in an ADR.

| Question | If yes → relevant standard(s) |
|---|---|
| Does the system process, store, or transmit **payment card data**? | PCI-DSS |
| Does it handle **US protected health information**? | HIPAA |
| Do enterprise customers require a **trust report**? | SOC 2 |
| Does it sell cloud services to **US federal/state government**? | FedRAMP/StateRAMP |
| Does it process **EU residents' personal data**? | GDPR, and consider ISO/IEC 27701 (PIMS) |
| Does it process **California residents' personal data**? | CCPA/CPRA |
| Is it a **public-facing web/native app** with a general audience? | WCAG 2.2 AA; EU-facing also EN 301 549 / European Accessibility Act |
| Does it ship a **desktop or mobile binary** to end users? | Code signing; SLSA provenance + SBOM; EU CRA if sold in the EU |
| Does an audit/customer/regulator expect a **named security management standard**? | ISO/IEC 27001/27002, or NIST CSF 2.0 |
| Does the system have **physical, financial, or life-safety consequences** on fault? | Domain-specific functional-safety standards (IEC 61508, ISO 26262, DO-178C, IEC 62304) — beyond this guide's scope |
| Does a contract or regulator require a **named process/testing standard**? | ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207/15288 (life cycle); 29119 (testing, contested — see [`13` §3](13-standards-crosswalk.md#3-software-testing)) |
