## Source Evaluation Notes

The strongest sources are **vendor/operator frameworks and standards bodies** (Well-Architected frameworks, NIST SSDF, OWASP ASVS, WCAG, Google SRE) because they are maintained and reflect production experience across many systems — but they are intentionally broad. **Practitioner books and pattern catalogs** (Fowler, Newman, Kleppmann, Evans, GoF) are best for trade-off language and failure modes.

Use sources as **inputs to decisions, not absolute rules**. Every source assumes a context: a small internal tool, a regulated financial platform, a global consumer web app, and a local-first desktop app each need a different level of rigor.

Specific quantitative figures in this reference (Core Web Vitals thresholds, availability "nines," framework binary sizes, OWASP rankings) reflect commonly published industry values at the verification date and may evolve — **always confirm against the current primary source for production decisions.**
